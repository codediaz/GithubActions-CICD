# 🛠️ | Configuration

Before you begin, make sure **Docker** is installed and that the script has the necessary execution permissions.

### 📂 | Navigate to the Script Directory 

Change to the script's directory:

```bash
cd src/nodeJs/
```

### ⚙︎ | Set Execution Permissions 

Assign execution rights to the script with this command:
```
chmod +x run_docker_nodejs.sh
```

### 🚀 | Run the Script
Execute the following to start your application:
```
./run_docker_nodejs.sh
```

_This will invoke the Docker container to run your PHP application. **Check your terminal for any output or error messages**._
